# AngularSeed

This is a basic template of the Atila front end to get you familiar with the front end set up.



## Prerequisites
You can also see the official [Angular QuickStart guide](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) for more information or ask someone on the Atila team.

Install [Node.jsÂ® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.

Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.

Then install the [Angular CLI globally](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

`npm install -g @angular/cli`


## Getting Started
Clone this directory to your local drive: `git clone https://github.com/atilatech/angular-seed.git`

Run `npm install` to install node packages.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Check your browser developer console to ensure everything is working properly. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Check the [Issues Page](https://github.com/atilatech/angular-seed/issues) to see what we need help with.

Thanks :)


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
